# scroll-world — Video models

Detail for SKILL.md Step 4. Schemas were confirmed against the Higgsfield CLI.

**This skill only ships seamless output**, so the only usable models are ones that can
frame-lock a seam: every chained clip must accept `--start-image`, and connectors also
need `--end-image`. That capability — not preference — is the selection rule. Check any
model with `higgsfield model get <job_type>` and **skip anything whose media inputs are
reference-only** (no start/end image): it can only *condition* a generation, not
*continue* a shot, so it physically can't hold a seam. Schemas below were confirmed
against the CLI:

| Model | start/end image | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seedance_2_0` (default) | ✓ / ✓ | Full chain (legs + connectors). `--mode std --resolution 1080p`. Its NSFW filter is the touchy one (see Gotchas). |
| `kling3_0` | ✓ / ✓ | Full chain — tested: `--mode std --sound off --duration 5` with start+end images accepted, seams frame-lock cleanly. **No `--resolution` param** (don't pass one; `--mode std` returns **720p native** — encode what ffprobe reports, never upscale). Sound defaults **on** → `--sound off`. `--duration` default 5, try 10 for legs. Different content filter than Seedance — the sanctioned NSFW fallback. |
| `seedance_2_0_mini` | ✓ / ✓ | Cheap draft tier that keeps frame-locking (720p). The previz tier: run the whole chain here first, then re-render final legs on the full model — still seamless, so it translates directly. |

Those three are the roster — all do both architectures. (`kling3_0_turbo` also frame-locks
via `--start-image`, but has no `--end-image`, so it's architecture-A-only and can't make
connectors; it also takes a different flag set — no `--mode`, has `--resolution` — so it
doesn't drop into the pipeline as-is. It's not in the default roster; only reach for it, and
wire it by hand, if architecture A's sequential render time is a proven bottleneck and you've
benchmarked it as actually faster.)

**Previz first (default, not optional-extra).** Unless the run is small (≤4 scenes),
render the whole chain on `seedance_2_0_mini` first. It frame-locks, so everything that
matters — journey order, camera grammar, seam continuity, copy pacing against the scrub —
is validated at draft cost; assemble the page from the previz clips and review it with
the user before a single full-model credit is spent. Then clear the draft clips, flip
`$VMODEL`, and re-render final (stills are reused; the pipeline's idempotency makes the
second pass mechanical — `references/pipeline.md`, setup block).

Rules:

- **One model for all chained clips.** Each renderer has its own motion/color/grain
  character; mixing models mid-chain keeps *position* continuity (frames still hand off)
  but the render-character shift reads as a subtle pop. The one sanctioned exception is
  the NSFW fallback for a single stubborn clip (Gotchas) — a slight character shift on
  one 5s connector beats a missing connector.
- Default to `seedance_2_0`; honor a user's stated preference **only if the model
  qualifies** (frame-locking). If it doesn't, say so and use a supported model — never
  ship a non-seamless build to satisfy a model request.
- The pipeline scripts take the model as `$VMODEL` with per-model flags already cased
  out (`references/pipeline.md`).
